AVERAGE CALCULATOR HTTP MICROSERVICE
This microservice calculates the average of numbers fetched from a third-party server based on specific qualifiers ('p' for prime, 'f' for Fibonacci, 'e' for even, and 'r' for random). It maintains a window size of 10, ensuring that stored numbers are unique and replacing the oldest number with the newest one upon breaching the window size.
